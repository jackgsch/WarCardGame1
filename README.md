# WarCardGame1

For this app I also followed a tutorial where I also got the images to use. After following the tutorial I made some of my own changes. Including formating, and adding a score feature.

I learned how to also make appIcons during this time. I used one of the supplied images and Sketch to make a simple yet sophisticated icon. I uploaded the icon to the app and then into testFlight. When I downloaded the app to my phone I was able to see the appIcon and play the game.
